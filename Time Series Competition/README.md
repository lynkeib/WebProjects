# Inroduction

This is a forecasting competition held between University of North Carolina (UNC) and University of Southern California (USC). Our task is to build various models and figure out which model  offers the best predictive power. We can use any AI, CI, ML, statistical and heuristic methods. Grading will be mainly based on average MAPE of training and holdout period:0.5*(MAPE of training period 2008-2011) + 0.5*(MAPE of holdout period 2012).If two submissions have MAPE values within 0.05%, the ranking will be based on the size of model defined by number of nonzero parameters. Smaller models will be ranked higher.
